<h2> Introduction </h2> 
<br> we plan to develop a <b>movie guessing game</b> where you would have to guess the name of the movie. The game could be played as a single player or two players could go head to head. 
To make the game easier we would also give hints.<br><br>
<h2>Game Rules</h2> 
<br> Single Player rules
  <ul> 
      <li> Player has to guess the name of the movie given some limited number of guesses (different for each movie) </li>
      <li> You can also opt to take a hint but that would result in reduction of points </li> 
      <li> Try and beat your high score! </li> 
  </ul>
<br> Two Player rules 
  <ul>
      <li> Two players go head to head </li> 
      <li> Since you are going head to head no hints will be provided </li> 
      <li> The player will both be guessing the same movie turn by turn </li> 
      <li> The player to guess the last remaining letter of the movie wins ( so be sure to think about your guess strategically ! ) </li>
  </ul>      
<h2> Functions to implement </h2> 
<br> A brief overview of most of the functions we are going to be implementing ( there may be changes in the given list, during the implementation stage.)
